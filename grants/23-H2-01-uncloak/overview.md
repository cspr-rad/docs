# Grant 23-H1-01 Overview

## Project

* Uncloak
* Rust based cryptography for blockchain engineers

## Project Lead

* Thor Kamphefner.
* First contact made at Cyptography 2022, he had a high profile amongst the attendees.Â 
* He presented upon the circumstances surrounding the Tornado Cash project.
* [Link](https://thork.net/) to his personal website.
* He has deep links to West Coast VC community, especially a16z - these links can be very useful.

## Knowledge wiki

* See [here](https://uncloak.org).
* This is a pedagogic resource with the aim to act as a one-stop shop for learning resources pertinent to the space.

## Rust Cryptography Engineering Study Group

* See [here](https://uncloak.org/courses/rust+cryptography+engineering/course-Rust+Cryptography+Engineering+Study+Group+Syllabus)
* This is a 4 month course aimed at getting rust engineers upto speed with applied cryptography.

## Events & Sponsorship Information

* See [here](https://hackmd.io/@thor314/rkdsG6mOo#What-Other-Events) for planned event participation - i.e. uncloak will organise side events at major conferences.
* See [here](https://hackmd.io/@thor314/rkdsG6mOo#Uncloak-Sponsorship) for sponsor information.
* ZK Summit & ZK Hacakthon would be ideal event for CSPR to sponsor.

## Strategic Objective

The strategic objective of this grant is to support the continuing work of the uncloak project.  It is thus an outreach grant whereby the cspr name will be amplified amongst a highly select community of rust engineers, applied cryptographers & decentralised systems experts.  Furthermore it can help to bring some positive feedback in respect of the cspr project image which currently is embarrassingly low within these rarified circles.

# 0. Prelude

Financial contracts are ubiquitous.  There are billions in existence.  They form the atomic unit of the global economic system.  The spectrum of contract types encompasses loans, bonds, mortgages, swaps, futures, options.  They find representation in balance sheets, P&L statements, compliance reports & risk models.  When securitized they form the backbone of capital markets.

Financial contract issuance is the domain of financial service entities.  Such entities situate a contract within a jurisdictional context.  They establish a set of counter-parties who commit to a set of terms.  They select an algorithm with which to derive the set of cash-flow obligations.  In response to macro and micro economic flux they update the derived cash-flows.  They actively track the contract's risk profile throughout it's lifecycle.

Yet despite their ubiquity financial contract issuance occurs in a standards vacuum.  Consider a set of contracts selected at random from amongst the billions.  How are the contract type, term sheet, future cash-flows and algorithms represented ?  Without doubt the set of responses will be heterogeneous.  This may apply even to contracts sampled from the portfolio of a single issuing entity.

A standards vacuum results in vast reconciliation and data ware housing costs.  Such costs are both financial and logistical.  They undermine accounting, financial analytics, risk management and regulatory reporting.  This translates into a reduced trust in the outputs of risk models which in turn compromises digital transformation strategies.  Executive leadership face operational logistics bottlenecks that undermine strategic direction.   

Even if standards existed, there would remain the issue of auditable trust.  Verifying the integrity of financial contracts remains an open problem.  A contract's term set and by extension it's associated cash-flows evolve over time.  At each stage in it's evolution one needs to re-establish trust in the contract's integrity.  Auditors need confidence in respect of the true state of a financial contract and associated portfolio(s).  To achieve this in real-time they require micro and macro machine auditing tools.

Standards based, trusted financial contracts are now within scope. This is due to the emergence of three distinct but complementary paradigms.  The first paradigm is the ACTUS standard, a well defined financial contract taxonomy expressed in two dimensions, semantic and algorithmic.  The second paradigm is the application of recent advances in applied cryptography such as blockchain, zero-knowledge proofs, secure multi-party computation and homomorphic encryption.  The third paradigm is quantative portfolio risk analysis underpinned by artifical intelligence.  Utilised in combination, these paradigms demonstrably improve existing appraches to lifecycle management and portfolio risk analysis.

During the course of this paper we outline a system that combines the determinism of ACTUS with the veracity of systems predicated upon applied cryptography and artifical intelligence.  Our intent is responsible innovation within the field of financial contract lifecycle and portfolio risk management.  In doing so we embrace diverse private and public sector stakeholder perspectives.  We aim to herald a new chapter in the history of finance.

# 2. Foundational Elements

As stated, the foundational elements of the system we propose are the ACTUS standard combined with applications of applied cryptography  and artificial intelligence.  In order to frame subsequent discussions around system design, we detail each of the foundational elements so as sketch out the available design space, a necessary pre-cursor to solution space discovery.  With respect to the various elements of applied cryptography, rather than focussing upon the dry technical details, we frame the narrative around detailing the benefits of leveraging such technology.

## 2.1. ACTUS financial contracts and lifecycle management

ACTUS (Algorithmic Contract Types Unified Standards) is a framework developed to standardize and formalize data and algorithms associated with financial contracts. It aims to provide a common language and structure for representing and processing various types of financial contracts, enabling improved risk management, analytics, and interoperability across different financial systems.

The lifecycle management of ACTUS financial contracts involves several key stages:

1. Contract Design: In this stage, the financial contract is defined, specifying its key terms and conditions. These terms include contract type, start and end dates, cash flow structure, payment obligations, interest rates, principal amounts, and any other relevant details.

2. Contract Execution: Once the contract is designed, it is executed between the involved parties. This involves the agreement and signing of the contract, often through legal documentation and/or electronic means.

3. Cash Flow Generation: During the life of the contract, cash flows are generated based on the agreed terms. These cash flows may include periodic interest payments, principal repayments, fees, penalties, and other contractual obligations. The timing and amounts of these cash flows are determined by the contract terms and any applicable market events.

4. Cash Flow Processing: The generated cash flows need to be processed and accounted for. This involves recording and validating the cash flow events, ensuring accuracy and compliance with the contract terms.

5. Contract Modification and Termination: In some cases, contracts may be modified or terminated before their original maturity date. Modifications can occur due to changes in contractual terms or events that trigger contractual adjustments. Termination may occur through full repayment, prepayment, early termination, or other contractually defined events.

6. Risk Management and Analytics: Throughout the contract lifecycle, various risk management and analytics activities are performed. This includes monitoring and evaluating the financial risks associated with the contract, such as credit risk, interest rate risk, market risk, and liquidity risk. Analytics may involve the calculation of risk measures, valuation, scenario analysis, and other assessments.

7. Contract Settlement: At the end of the contract, settlement processes are executed to finalize the financial obligations. This may involve the transfer of funds, securities, or other assets between the contracting parties, based on the contract terms and conditions.

ACTUS aims to provide a standardized framework to represent and manage financial contracts across different financial systems, facilitating interoperability, risk management, and regulatory compliance. It enables financial institutions, regulators, and technology providers to have a common understanding and processing capability for financial contracts, enhancing transparency and efficiency in the financial industry.

This makes fraud and unauthorized modifications extremely difficult and costly to execute.

Overall, distributed ledgers provide a promising solution for financial contract management by improving trust, security, and efficiency in the process, while also reducing the reliance on intermediaries and manual interventions. However, like any technology, their adoption requires careful consideration of the specific use case and potential challenges in implementation.

## 2.3. Benefits of zero knowledge rollups

Zero-knowledge rollups are a technology that combines the benefits of blockchain technology with zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) to enhance the scalability, privacy, and efficiency of financial contract management. In the context of financial contracts, zero-knowledge rollups can offer several advantages:

1. Scalability: One of the primary challenges in blockchain-based financial systems is scalability. Zero-knowledge rollups address this challenge by aggregating multiple transactions into a single proof. Instead of processing every transaction on the blockchain, the rollup compresses them into a succinct proof, reducing the computational and storage requirements. This allows for a higher throughput of transactions, enabling financial contract management at a larger scale.

2. Privacy: Financial contracts often involve sensitive information, such as trade details, financial positions, and counterparties' identities. Zero-knowledge rollups enable privacy-preserving financial contract management by allowing participants to prove the validity of their transactions without revealing the underlying details. The zero-knowledge proofs validate the correctness of the transactions while keeping the details confidential, ensuring privacy for the parties involved.

3. Cost Efficiency: Zero-knowledge rollups can significantly reduce transaction costs compared to traditional blockchain solutions. By aggregating multiple transactions into a single proof, the rollup reduces the number of on-chain operations and associated fees. This makes financial contract management more cost-effective, particularly for complex contracts that involve numerous transactions.

4. Security and Trust: Zero-knowledge rollups leverage the security properties of blockchain technology to ensure the integrity and immutability of financial contracts. The rollup transactions are committed to the underlying blockchain, benefiting from its robust consensus mechanism and decentralized nature. This enhances the trustworthiness of financial contract management and reduces the reliance on centralized intermediaries.

5. Interoperability: Zero-knowledge rollups can be designed to be compatible with existing blockchain networks and smart contract platforms. This enables seamless integration with other financial systems and enhances the interoperability of financial contract management. Parties can interact with financial contracts on different platforms while benefiting from the scalability and privacy features provided by the rollup technology.

Overall, zero-knowledge rollups offer an innovative approach to financial contract management, addressing scalability, privacy, cost, security, and interoperability challenges. By leveraging the power of zero-knowledge proofs and blockchain technology, they provide an efficient and secure framework for processing and managing financial contracts in a scalable and privacy-preserving manner.

## 2.4. Benefits of secure multi-party computation

Secure Multi-Party Computation (SMPC) offers several significant benefits for financial contract management. SMPC is a cryptographic technique that enables multiple parties to jointly compute a function on their private inputs without revealing any individual data to others. When applied to financial contract management, SMPC can enhance security, privacy, efficiency, and transparency. Here are some specific benefits:

1. **Privacy and Confidentiality**: Financial contracts often involve sensitive and proprietary information about the parties involved. SMPC ensures that each party's private data remains encrypted and confidential, even during computation. This way, participants can collaborate on contract management without exposing their confidential data to others, reducing the risk of data breaches and unauthorized access.

2. **Data Security**: SMPC protects against insider threats and external attacks. As the private data stays encrypted throughout the computation process, it minimizes the risk of data leakage or manipulation. Even if a participant's system is compromised, the data remains secure from unauthorized access.

3. **Trustless Collaboration**: SMPC enables parties to work together without fully trusting each other. It ensures that no single entity has full access to all the data involved in the financial contract. This distributed approach fosters trust and reduces the need for intermediaries, which can lead to cost savings and increased efficiency.

4. **Real-Time Efficiency**: Financial contracts often require complex calculations and data processing. With SMPC, parties can perform these computations simultaneously in real-time while maintaining privacy. This can streamline contract execution and reduce the time required for agreement settlements.

5. **Reduced Counterparty Risk**: In traditional financial contract management, parties might be concerned about potential default or non-compliance from other participants. SMPC can mitigate counterparty risk by ensuring that the contract terms are executed correctly without revealing sensitive data that could be exploited by dishonest parties.

6. **Auditability and Transparency**: SMPC ensures that the computation process is transparent and verifiable. Although individual inputs remain private, the final output is collectively known and can be audited to ensure the integrity of the contract management process.

7. **Compliance and Regulatory Requirements**: Financial contracts often need to adhere to strict regulatory requirements and compliance standards. SMPC can aid in meeting these standards by providing a secure and privacy-preserving environment for contract management, ensuring that data is handled in accordance with regulations.

8. **Cross-Organizational Collaboration**: In the financial industry, contracts often involve multiple organizations and stakeholders. SMPC allows secure collaboration across organizations without exposing sensitive data to external parties, enabling smoother interactions and reducing barriers to cooperation.

9. **Resilience to Data Breaches**: Even if one party's data is compromised, the SMPC protocol ensures that the remaining participants' data remains protected. This resilience to data breaches enhances the overall security of financial contract management.

In conclusion, Secure Multi-Party Computation offers numerous benefits for financial contract management, including enhanced privacy, data security, efficiency, transparency, and compliance. By leveraging SMPC, financial institutions can improve their contract management processes and strengthen their overall security posture.

# 3. Solution Pillars

Having reviewed limitations of current systems and outlined foundational elements of the proposed system, we can now proceed to outlining the conceptual pillars of the proposed system.  These pillars are integrity, tokenisation, payments and risk analysis.  Whilst the pillars are considered to be inter-dependent, the integrity pillar may be viewed as foundational.

## 3.1 Integrity

Establishing verifiable data and algorithmic integrity in respect of all financial contracts flowing through the system is an absolute requirement.  This requirement holds for all moments in the lifecycle of a single financial contract and by extension any associated portfolios.  

1. **Trust and Transparency**: Verifiable data and algorithmic integrity instill trust among parties involved in financial contracts. When data and algorithms can be verified independently, it enhances transparency and reduces the risk of hidden manipulations or biases.

2. **Risk Management**: Financial contracts often involve significant risks. Verifiable data ensures that the inputs and assumptions used in risk models and calculations are accurate, leading to more reliable risk assessments and management strategies.

3. **Regulatory Compliance**: Many financial contracts are subject to regulatory oversight. Establishing data and algorithmic integrity helps ensure compliance with regulatory requirements, which often demand transparency and validation of financial calculations.

4. **Auditability**: Verifiable data and algorithms facilitate easier and more comprehensive auditing of financial contracts. Auditors can independently validate the accuracy of data and calculations, ensuring compliance with accounting standards and best practices.

5. **Preventing Fraud and Manipulation**: Financial contracts are susceptible to fraud and manipulation, whether intentional or unintentional. By establishing data and algorithmic integrity, organizations can reduce the risk of fraudulent activities and protect the interests of all stakeholders.

6. **Enhanced Decision Making**: Accurate and verifiable data is essential for making informed decisions in financial contract management. Reliable algorithms and calculations provide a solid foundation for strategic planning and investment decisions.

7. **Dispute Resolution**: In case of disputes or disagreements, verifiable data and algorithms serve as an objective basis for resolving conflicts. Parties can refer to independently validated information to reach an impartial resolution.

8. **Market Reputation**: Organizations that prioritize data and algorithmic integrity can build a reputation for reliability and accuracy, attracting more clients and business partners.

9. **Preventing Data Breaches**: Verifiable data minimizes the risk of unauthorized access and data breaches. Confidential financial information remains secure and cannot be altered without detection.

11. **Long-Term Stability**: Establishing data and algorithmic integrity is vital for the long-term stability of financial contracts and investment strategies. Relying on inaccurate or unreliable data can lead to severe financial consequences over time.

## 3.2 Tokenisation

### 3.2.1 Overview

Tokensiation modelling is both an art and a science.  Hitherto such models have focussed upon platform, governance, utility and non-fungible tokens.  Seen through the prism of financial instrument types it may be argued that the tokens have represented digital and digitised assets augmented by various derivative instruments.

Within the context of servicing ACTUS compliant financial contract the focus of tokenisation modelling becomes representing exposure to the set of active **counter-party obligations**, i.e. tokenisation of cash-flow promises.  By definition flows are bi-directional and hence the proposed system tokenisation model is bi-dimensional.  

For each financial contract, an umbrella token will be issued.  The umbrella token will be associated a set of security policies plus a set of legal documents (stored in a decentralised file archive).  It will also be associated with two sub-tokens, each sub-token represents directional counter-party exposure to the underlying financial contract.  Security policies determine whether the sub-tokens may be considered mutable or immutable at any moment in time.

### 3.2.2 Illustrated Example

For example, imagine a corporate bond issued by a set of banks to a private equity entity such as a telecoms provider.  Three banks (A, B and C) come together to issue a 100 million EUR bond to the private entity (X).  The bond represents the financial contract the terms of which have been agreed upon by the four counter-parties.  

TODO: continue

## 3.3 Payments

### 3.3.1 Overview

Once the integrity and tokenisation pillars are established, a payments engine can be constructed.  The verifiable  event sequence emitted by the ACTUS computational core acts as inputs to the payments engine.  

The payments schedule is constructed in terms of financial contract identifier, timestamp, amount and currency.  For each schedule payment, a set of payment channels are established based upon interrogation of the contract's associated token.    

TODO: continue

### 3.3.2 Illustrated Example

TODO: outline a sample of payments in the life cycle of the bond example.

## 3.4 Risk Analysis

TODO describe:

- How the cleanliness of the ACTUS data model naturally supports forward looking risk analyis.

- How homomorphic encryption supports running risk models in a fully encrypted computational environment

- How as a counter-part to the ACTUS computational core in respect of deriving counter-party obligations, we will construct an ACTUS portfolio risk simulation platform.
